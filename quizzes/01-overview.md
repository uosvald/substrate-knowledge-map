# Quiz 1: Overview

## Overview

This quiz covers the following parts of the Substrate Knowledge Map:

- [Why Substrate?](../../knowledge-map#why-substrate-substrate-blockchain-vs-smart-contract/)

- [Navigating Our Documentations](../../knowledge-map#navigating-our-documentations/)

### 1. What is correct about Substrate runtime development and Smart Contract developement? Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. Substrate gives developers total control on the blockchain.
- [ ] B. Both type of developments allow you to configure the fee of a transaction.
- [ ] C. Directly working on runtime developement usually result in faster execution, while smart contract execution is slower and costlier.
- [ ] D. It is generally easier to program with Smart Contract and have a faster pace of development.

### 2. What is a key characteristic that Substrate gives runtime developers? Check all that apply.

- [ ] A. Low-level access to the entire blockchain.
- [ ] B. You can configure the consensus engine of the Substrate network.
- [ ] C. You can update the runtime logic without the whole network going through a hard fork.
- [ ] D. Runtime gives you a lot of safe guards and security compared to smart contract development.

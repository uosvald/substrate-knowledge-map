F. Both B and D. 

### 4. The tradeoff between technical freedom and development ease in Substrate implies ... 

A. On the one hand, Substrate comes with out-of-the-box easy to use modules for blockhain development; but on the other hand developing custom modules and blockchain architectures requires more in depth technical know-how of Substrate's CORE libraries.

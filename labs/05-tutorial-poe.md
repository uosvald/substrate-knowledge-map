# Lab 5 - Tutorial: Building a Proof-of-existence (PoE) dApp

## Task

Complete the [Build a Proof-of-Existence Decentralized Application](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/proof-of-existence) tutorial, a good tutorial showcasing end-to-end hands-on dApp development in Substrate, where you'll also learn how to build a simple front-end and interact with it.

## Submission Instructions

When you have finished this tutorial, you should have a Node Template with a `pallet-template` customized for our proof of existence, and a front end to customized to interact with this pallet. Save the customized Node template under `/lab-answers/05/node-template`, and the front end at `/lab-answers/05/frontend`.

1. Commit the code and push it to the remote git repository. Submit the link to your repository **at the proper branch and directory where your Node Template and Front-end Template is located**.

2. Use the customized Front-end Template to claim the existence of a file by calling `createClaim`.
After you have successfully submit that extrinsic with `ClaimCreated` event emitted, make a
screenshot of that and submit it.
